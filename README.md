### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zambraju/zambraju** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mass Timber modular construction, I am exited with the progress that I have done since I started working on it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be more efficient when coding
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on code development so I can learn a bit more from other people
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a good way to improve my writing skills so I can share what I do
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about cars, bikes, or even about my country, I like making new friends
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: just send me an email or a message
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
--> Just ask whatever you want, I will be happy to answer or help with that!!
